ðŸ“Œ Real-World Applications:

1. Signal Processing:
   - Used in digital signal transformation where alternating values represent wave fluctuations.

2. Financial Data Normalization:
   - Alternating profit/loss sequences help in simplifying financial trends.

3. Data Visualization:
   - Alternating signs can be used in bar graphs to represent deviation above/below a baseline.

4. Load Balancing:
   - In scheduling systems, alternating light and heavy tasks ensures even distribution of load.

5. Event Simulation:
   - Useful in systems like games or models where actions alternate in type (e.g., attack/defend).

----------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“š Algorithmic Concepts Practiced:

- Two-pointer technique with index tracking.
- Preserving relative order while applying constraints.
- Greedy placement without backtracking.
