"""
Nice one, Tanu! The **"move zeroes"** problem is another gem that shows up both in interviews (DSA world) and in the real world. Let‚Äôs break it down for both sides:

---

### üß† **DSA Applications** (Interview & Algorithm World)
1. **In-Place Array Rearrangement**  
   Classic problem: move all zeroes to the end while keeping the order of non-zero elements. Solved with two pointers in O(n) time.

2. **Partitioning Arrays**  
   It helps practice element segregation techniques, similar to Dutch National Flag or QuickSort partition logic.

3. **Space Optimization**  
   Encourages solutions without using extra space‚Äîgreat for refining your array manipulation chops.

4. **Streaming Data Structures**  
   Useful in maintaining active (non-zero) elements in memory buffers while "pushing out" inactive ones.

---

### üåç **Real-World Applications**
1. **Sparse Data Cleanup**  
   In data analysis or machine learning, zeroes often represent missing or irrelevant values. "Moving them" means filtering out the signal from the noise.

2. **Game Development**  
   Think of grid-based games (like 2048)‚Äîyou move tiles (non-zeroes) while pushing zeroes away. It‚Äôs core logic!

3. **UI & Frontend State Management**  
   Zeros can represent "empty slots" in lists or carousels‚Äîshifting them to the end makes the interface more intuitive.

4. **Inventory Systems**  
   Items with quantity zero may need to be pushed to the end when displaying product lists.

5. **Memory & Cache Simulation**  
   Zeroes can signify unused memory slots‚Äîorganizing arrays helps in simulating memory defragmentation or LRU logic.

It‚Äôs pretty cool how a small idea like moving zeroes touches everything from games to data pipelines.
